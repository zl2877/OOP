## General Description
The system that we want to implement is an online ordering system for bubble tea. When the user enters the system, the client will have the option to “start order”. After pressing the “start order” button, there will be the option to first select a type of tea (e.g. Green tea, Black tea, Oolong tea, etc). Then there is the option to customize the tea by choosing an “ice” and “sugar” level, “size” and adding in other toppings. If any of the selection is not being set, there will be a warning message pop up to remind the user which section is not being filled correctly. 
After the selection process is finished, the user can add the tea to the shopping cart.
Then the client will have the option to add more cups of tea (which takes them back to the tea selection page at the start) or check out (which is the end of the system).
If the user selects “check out”, the client can place the order and a final price will be displayed.
