## General Description
The system that we want to implement is an online ordering system for bubble tea. When the user enters the system, the client will have the option to “start order”. After pressing the “start order” button, there will be the option to first select a type of tea (e.g. Green tea, Black tea, Oolong tea, etc). Then there is the option to customize the tea by choosing an “ice” and “sugar” level, “size” and adding in other toppings. If any of the selection is not being set, there will be a warning message pop up to remind the user which section is not being filled correctly. 
After the selection process is finished, the user can add the tea to the shopping cart.
Then the client will have the option to add more cups of tea (which takes them back to the tea selection page at the start) or check out (which is the end of the system).
If the user selects “check out”, the client can place the order and a final price will be displayed.

## Benefits
This system is particularly useful for when the customer wants to save time by ordering before they arrive in the store. Therefore when they arrive at the store, they can immediately get the drink and do not have to wait in a long queue. 
This is also really good for customers that are not familiar with the menu, as they can avoid the awkwardness of having to be put on the spot in the store by being able to look at what is available beforehand and having more time to decide what they want. 
This system also makes it easier for customers to customize their drink (e.g. selecting ice/sugar level, adding other ingredients), as they can see what they selected on their screens. 

## User
This system’s main users are those who like bubble tea, and visit bubble tea stores. This system is for users who are familiar with operating a mobile device. This is intended for users who are in a rush, by using this, they can save time. It is also for users who feel more comfortable without having to interact with a waiter/waitress at the counter.
## Goals
We are thinking about this system as something that can be used as a web page or app on a mobile phone, so the user can order their drink while they are walking to the store. This will help to save their time so they don’t need to wait as long at the store.  
## System Inputs and Outputs
The system’s input will be from the user’s choice, where the user can select their preference by selecting from the drop boxes. For our system, we are storing the data (information of the user’s selection) in a text file. Furthermore, the file that stores data of each order could be used by the store manager to review the sales of the bubble tea shop, so as to provide better help for improving management and operation.
